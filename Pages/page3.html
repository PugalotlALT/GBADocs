	<h1>Part 3: Our first ROM</h1>
	
	The time has finally come for us to write our first program for the GBA. If you haven’t already installed the 
	prerequisite software you can find a list of required software <a href="./page0.html">here</a>. If you’re all ready, 
	create a file titled “Example1.asm” and open it in your text editor of choice. With your file open, paste the following 
	code below. Alternatively, you can download a copy of this program <a href="../Examples/Example1.asm">here</a>.
	
	<pre>
.org 0x08000000

b SetThumbMode

.space 188

SetThumbMode:
	adr r0, Main
	add r0, r0, #1
	bx r0			;Sets code to Thumb mode

	.thumb
Main:
	ldr r0, DisplayAddress
	ldr r1, Mode3BG2
	str r1, [r0,#0]		;Sets display mode to Mode 3 on BG2
	
	ldr r0, VRAMAddress
	ldr r1, Colour
	ldr r2, CanvasSizeDiv3	;Stores the VRAM address and colour to write
	
DrawLoop:
	strh r1,[r0,#0]		;Writes the colour to the VRAM address
	add r0, r0, #6		;Moves 3 pixels forward
	sub r2, r2, #1		;Minus one from the canvas counter
	bne DrawLoop
	
Infinite:
	b Infinite
	
	.align 4
DisplayAddress:
	.long 0x4000000		;The first I/O register
	
VRAMAddress:
	.long 0x6000000		;The start of VRAM
	
Mode3BG2:
	.int 0x0403		;The I/O command to set Mode 3
	
Colour:
	.long 0x7AFB		;The colour to display
	
CanvasSizeDiv3:
	.long 0x3200		;The canvas counter divided by 3
	</pre>

	Once you have copied this code, open up a command prompt in your current directory and run the following command (also copy
	the vasm EXE from the first part to this directory if you have not added it to the PATH):
	
	<pre>
vasmarm_std.exe Example1.asm -m7tdmi -noialign -chklabels -nocase -Fbin -o Example1.gba
	</pre>
	
	You should now see a file called "Example1.gba" in your directory. Run this file in your emulator of choice, and if you see
	vertical purple lines on your screen: Congratulations! You have successfully made your first GBA ROM. But how exactly does
	this code work? That is what we will discuss in the next part of this series. Stay tuned!
