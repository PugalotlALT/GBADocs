	<h1>Part 2: GBA Modes</h1>
	
	The GBA can display data on the 240x160px screen in a variety of ways known as modes. There are six of these modes, 3 being 
	bitmap and 3 being tile modes and are numbered 0 to 5.
	
	<h1>Bitmap</h1>
	Bitmap modes involve the manipulation of pixels on the screen and are numbered 3 to 5. Mode 3 involves writing a 15 bit RGB 
	value to any point in VRAM. Mode 4 involves writing an 8 bit reference to a RGB value stored in palette RAM and allows for 
	a backbuffer (two screens available, so you can draw on one screen while displaying the other). Mode 5 has 15 bit RGB values 
	as well as a backbuffer, but the screen is shrunk to 160x128 due to the larger space necessary.
	
	<h1>Tiles</h1>
	Tile modes involve writing references to tile maps stored in VRAM and are numbered 0 to 2. Tile modes can contain between 2 
	to 4 layers which allow for layering (duh) and turning on and off different tiles. Mode 0 has 4 regular background layers 
	which allow for scrolling but not rotation or scaling. Mode 1 has 3 backgrounds, 1 which allows rotation and scaling and 2 
	regular backgrounds. Mode 2 contains 2 rotatable and scalable backgrounds.
	
	<h1>BGs and Objects</h1>
	As mentioned above, in Modes 0 to 2 you can enable backgrounds and objects. These are able to be turned on and off using one 
	of the I/O registers, scrolled and rotated and scaled depending on what type of mode is set. Similar to backgrounds, objects 
	can also be turned on and off. This effect can be used to create GUIs and title screens quickly without having to clear the 
	screen.

	Of course, there are many more nuances to these modes such as BG priority and character blocks. However, enough theory, 
	letâ€™s start working on our first GBA ROM. Stay tuned!
