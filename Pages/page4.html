	<h1>Part 4: Our first ROM - An explanation</h1>
	
	In the previous section we created our first ROM which displays lines down the screen. But how exactly does this program 
	work? This part will cover the previous code step by step with explanations of how it works. Get ready for some explaining!
	
	<pre>
.org 0x08000000

b SetThumbMode

.space 188
	</pre>
	
	This section indicates the code should be placed at the address 0x08000000, the start of the ROM area. It then jumps to the 
	start of the program (ARM uses "b" for branch instead of the traditional "jmp" command on other architectures. We then allocate 
	188 bytes for the GBA header. Why do we do that? Stay tuned!
	
	<pre>
SetThumbMode:
	adr r0, Main
	add r0, r0, #1	;#1 represents the constant 1
	bx r0			;Sets code to Thumb mode

	.thumb
	</pre>
	
	The GBA doesn't start in THUMB mode, so we must set it to THUMB mode manually. This is done by using a bx (Branch and eXchange) 
	instruction. This instruction sets the program counter (where the program is) to the supplied register as well as changing the 
	program state to ARM or THUMB. To set the mode we must change the first bit (the smallest) to 0 for ARM or 1 for THUMB. We 
	achieve this by loading the address of our Main function into r0 (Register 0) and add 1. We know this sets the smallest bit to 
	1 as ARM instructions are 4 bytes in length. We then run the bx command to jump to our code. The ".thumb" tells the compiler 
	that the rest of our code is THUMB machine code.
	
	<pre>
Main:
	ldr r0, DisplayAddress
	ldr r1, Mode3BG2
	str r1, [r0,#0]		;Sets display mode to Mode 3 on BG2
	</pre>
	
	Before we draw anything to the screen we need to set the GBA to the correct mode. This is done by setting the I/O register at 
	0x4000000 to the value 0x0403. I won't go into too much detail here so if you want to learn more, check out the description 
	<a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/video.htm">here</a> (Section 4.5 specifically). We do this by loading r0 with the 
	register address and r1 with the command and use a str instruction. For the str instruction "str A, [B,C]" this translates 
	into "Store the 32-bit value from A into the address (B+C)".
	
	<br><br>
	
	If you have had previous experience with assembly you may have noticed we load a lot of data from addresses in memory when we 
	could load them directly with something like a "mov" command. This is because of the limited space of THUMB instructions. The 
	largest constant we can load into a register using a "mov" command is 255. To get around this, we store the required values in 
	memory and load them using a "ldr" instruction, or "Load Register".
	
	<pre>
	ldr r0, VRAMAddress
	ldr r1, Colour
	ldr r2, CanvasSizeDiv3	;Stores the VRAM address and colour to write
	</pre>
	
	This section involves us loading the required variables for the drawing loop. This involves setting r0 to the start of VRAM, 
	r1 to our colour of choice and r2 to the canvas size divided by 3 (required for drawing lines instead of filling the screen).
	
	<pre>
DrawLoop:
	strh r1,[r0,#0]		;Writes the colour to the VRAM address
	add r0, r0, #6		;Moves 3 pixels forward
	sub r2, r2, #1		;Minus one from the canvas counter
	bne DrawLoop
	
Infinite:
	b Infinite
	</pre>

	This is the section which actually does the drawing on the screen. It starts by setting the 2-byte pixel value at the VRAM 
	address to our colour. We then increment the VRAM address by 6, or 3 2-byte pixels before subtracting 1 from the canvas size.
	By doing this we set the conditional codes, a hidden register which keeps track of the result of the last instruction. We 
	utilise this by using a bne, or "Branch if Not Equal" to stay in the drawing loop if r2 does not equal 0. If it does, we move 
	on to Infinite, a simple infinite loop to keep the program running.
	
	<pre>
	.align 4
DisplayAddress:
	.long 0x4000000		;The first I/O register
	
VRAMAddress:
	.long 0x6000000		;The start of VRAM
	
Mode3BG2:
	.int 0x0403		;The I/O command to set Mode 3
	
Colour:
	.long 0x7AFB		;The colour to display
	
CanvasSizeDiv3:
	.long 0x3200		;The canvas counter divided by 3
	</pre>
	
	This is the section which defines all the required values for the code above. One important thing to recognise is the ".align 
	4" command which makes sure the following instructions are aligned to 4 bytes, a requirement for the "ldr" command.
	
	<br><br>
	
	Well, there you go! Now you know how this program works, why don't you try a hand at some of these challenges?
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			Using <a href="http://www.budmelvin.com/dev/15bitconverter.html">this</a> site, try changing the colour of the lines drawn.
		</li>
		<li>
			Try changing the program so that it fills the whole screen instead of just lines.
		</li>
		<li>
			Try and change the program to only colour the bottom half of the screen.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	While you do have a working ROM, this program will not run on the GBA. Why is that? Well, it all has to do with the 188 bytes 
	reserved for the GBA header. And what is that? Well, stay tuned!
