	<p>
	Welcome to GBADocs! This site aims to teach the fundamentals of programming for the GBA in Arm THUMB Assembly. 
	Just so we’re all on the same page, let’s define some terms.
	</p>
	<h1>What is the GBA?</h1>
	<p>
	The GBA, or GameBoy Advance is a Nintendo console released in 2001. This was a handheld console designed to play Nintendo and officially licensed cartridges. 
	The goal of this tutorial series is to turn our Assembly code into a working .gba file (the filetype associated with GBA ROMs, or the Read-Only Memory of a cartridge).
	</p>
	<h1>What is Assembly?</h1>
	<p>
	Computers are designed to read machine code which consists of a sequence of binary digits to represent instructions for a computer. 
	Obviously it would be highly inconvenient for programmers to write directly in “1”s and “0”s, so we created Assembly, a language which is <b>nearly</b> a one-to-one conversion 
	between machine code and more human-readable language.

	Not every system has the same machine code however. Depending on the processor, different instructions might be included. For example, if you are reading this on a desktop 
	computer running Windows or Linux, the processor in that device is probably running some version of x86 Assembly. The GBA uses the ARM7TDMI processor which does not run 
	on x86, but rather Arm.
