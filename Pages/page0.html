	<h1>Page 0: An Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	Welcome to GBADocs! This site aims to teach the fundamentals of programming for the GBA in Arm THUMB Assembly. 
	Just so we’re all on the same page, let’s define some terms.
	</p>
	<h1>What is the GBA?</h1>
	<p>
	The GBA, or GameBoy Advance is a Nintendo console released in 2001. This was a handheld console designed to play Nintendo and officially licensed cartridges. 
	The goal of this tutorial series is to turn our Assembly code into a working .gba file (the filetype associated with GBA ROMs, or the Read-Only Memory of a cartridge).
	</p>
	<h1>What is Assembly?</h1>
	<p>
	Computers are designed to read machine code which consists of a sequence of binary digits to represent instructions for a computer. 
	Obviously it would be highly inconvenient for programmers to write directly in “1”s and “0”s, so we created Assembly, a language which is <b>nearly</b> a one-to-one conversion 
	between machine code and more human-readable language.

	<br><br>

	Not every system has the same machine code however. Depending on the processor, different instructions might be included. For example, if you are reading this on a desktop 
	computer running Windows or Linux, the processor in that device is probably running some version of x86 Assembly. The GBA uses the ARM7TDMI processor which does not run 
	on x86, but rather Arm. This architecture is commonly used on devices such as mobile phones and single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi.
	
	<br><br>
	
	For this tutorial specifically we use a subset of Arm’s instruction set called Thumb. This is a mode in the processor 
	that reduces the instruction set to 16-bit instructions instead of the traditional 32-bit instructions of traditional 
	Arm Assembly. This is especially beneficial for devices with limited ROM space such as the GBA. However, many of the 
	concepts and code snippets can be edited to work with the regular Arm instruction set.

	<br><br>
	
	While I try to explain all the code snippets present in this tutorial, some basic understanding of Assembly is required 
	to follow along with this guide. Some amazing resources to learn Assembly from scratch include the 
	<a href="https://cpu.land/">Putting the “You” in CPU</a> site by HackClub or the <a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/assemblytutorial/">
	Programmed Introduction to MIPS Assembly Language</a>, a tutorial for another instruction set.
	
	<br><br>
	
	<h1>Tools</h1>
	
	Throughout the tutorial I will introduce tools to do specific tasks such as sprite editing and compilation. However, 
	there are some prerequisite tools required before starting. These include:
	
	<h1>vasm</h1>

	<a href="http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/index.php?view=binrel">vasm</a> is the compiler we will use for the duration of 
	this tutorial. This tutorial uses “vasmarm_std_Win64.zip” specifically, but other builds may work as well. You can run 
	this by extracting the ZIP and copying the EXE to your working directory or adding it to your path on Windows.
	
	<h1>GBA Emulator</h1>
	
	To run your code quickly without having to use a flash cart on a real GBA you can use a GBA emulator. The one that I 
	primarily use and recommend is <a href="https://mgba.io/">mGBA</a>. This emulator is nearly fully accurate to the real 
	GBA and has support for simple debugging. 
	
	<br><br>
	
	In the next part we will learn more about how the GBA memory is structured. Stay tuned!
