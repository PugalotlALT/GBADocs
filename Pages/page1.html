	<h1>Page 1: GBA Memory</h1>
	
	The main way to communicate with the GBA is not through software interrupts like on most OS's (although the GBA does have 
	some). Instead, data is displayed and read by storing and loading from memory blocks and special I/O register addresses. 
	These blocks are each designated for specific purposes which are listed below.
	
	<h1>WRAM</h1>
	Between 0x02000000 - 0x0203FFFF and 0x03000000 - 0x03007FFF is WRAM, or Working RAM. This is the block in memory which programs 
	are able to use freely to store whatever data they so desire.
	
	<h1>I/O Registers</h1>
	Between 0x04000000 - 0x040003FE are the I/O registers or Input/Output registers. Usually 16 bits in length, these are a 
	group of registers used for controlling the functions of the GBA such as visible screens and keypad inputs.
